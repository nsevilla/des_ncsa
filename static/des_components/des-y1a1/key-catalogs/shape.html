      <strong>Overview</strong>
    </h2>
    <p>From <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1708.01533">Zuntz &amp; Sheldon et al. 2018</a>:</p>
    <p>We present two galaxy shape catalogues from the Dark Energy Survey Year 1 data set, covering ~1500 square degrees with a median redshift of 0.59. The catalogues cover two main fields: Stripe 82, and an area overlapping the South Pole Telescope survey region. We describe our data analysis process and in particular our shape measurement using two independent shear measurement pipelines, METACALIBRATION and IM3SHAPE. The METACALIBRATION catalogue uses a Gaussian model with an innovative internal calibration scheme, and was applied to riz-bands, yielding 34.8M objects. The IM3SHAPE catalogue uses a maximum-likelihood bulge/disc model calibrated using simulations, and was applied to r-band data, yielding 21.9M objects. Both catalogues pass a suite of null tests that demonstrate their fitness for use in weak lensing science. We estimate the 1 sigma uncertainties in multiplicative shear calibration to be 0.013 and 0.025 for the METACALIBRATION and IM3SHAPE catalogues, respectively. We further deliver a file containing redshift information, with the location of each object in the redshift bins shown in <a class="external-link" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.478..592H" rel="nofollow">Hoyle &amp; Gruen et al.

      </span>. It is important to note that the METACALIBRATION catalog contains information necessary to calibrate an arbitrary selection (based on properties measured in this or related METACALIBRATION catalogs - i.e., griz METACALIBRATION flux measurements for photometric redshifts), unlike other forms of shear calibration that are valid only for a particular ensemble selection. <strong>If making selections beyond the METACALIBRATION catalog flags_select, the shear calibration will no longer be correct. </strong>

    <h3 class="auto-cursor-target">REDSHIFT BINNING INFORMATION</h3>
    <p>This table of integers indicates the tomographic redshift bin of each object based on the four bins defined in <a class="external-link" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.478..592H" rel="nofollow">Hoyle &amp; Gruen et al. (2018)</a>. -1 means not in any bin (outside the range z=0.3-1.3). The tomographic bin placement is based on the mean redshift of the PDF, within the ranges (0.3-0.43, 0.43-0.63, 0.63-0.9, 0.9-1.3). Because of the use of photometric information for binning from MOF in im3shape and from metacalibration-measured fluxes in metacalibration, the binning differs between the two shape catalogs. The photometric information measured with metacalibration on artificially sheared images allows for the correction of photo-z based selection biases on shear signals.</p>

They are only valid if interpreted with the redshift bins and source selections made upon the METACALIBRATION or IM3SHAPE catalog flags_select and redshift bins defined in this catalog, and should be interpreted with the systematic uncertainties on mean redshift defined in <a class="external-link" href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018MNRAS.478..592H" rel="nofollow">Hoyle &amp; Gruen et al.
