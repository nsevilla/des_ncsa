<h3 class="fixdown">1. How do I select stars/galaxies?  &nbsp; &nbsp; <a style="font-size:0.72rem" href="javascript:void(0)" on-tap="_top">(Top)</a></h3>

<div class="answer" style="diplay: inline;"> We recommend the use of the SExtractor <a href="https://sextractor.readthedocs.io/en/des_dr1/Model.html#spread-model-def">SPREAD_MODEL</a>, which compares the fit of a local PSF model to a slightly extended exponential disk model. Below we show a example using SPREAD_MODEL for object classification in a way that is suitable for both stellar and extragalactic science.
<p>We define a new variable EXTENDED_COADD as the independent sum of several Boolean conditions:</p>
<p>EXTENDED_COADD =<br/>((SPREAD_MODEL_I+ 3 × SPREADERR_MODEL_I) &gt; 0.005)<br/>+ ((SPREAD_MODEL_I+SPREADERR_MODEL_I) &gt; 0.003)<br/>+ ((SPREAD_MODEL_I-SPREADERR_MODEL_I) &gt; 0.003)</p>
<p>Note that EXTENDED_COADD is defined by a sequence of boolean conditions that, when true, add a unit to the classifier. This classifier results in a value of 0 (high-confidence stars), 1 (likely stars), 2 (mostly galaxies), and 3 (high-confidence galaxies).  <span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">Although the SExtractor quantity<a href="https://sextractor.readthedocs.io/en/des_dr1/ClassStar.html#class-star-def"> CLASS_STAR</a> has been commonly used in the past, we find that SPREAD_MODEL based classifiers consistently outperform CLASS_STAR. <span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);"> It is expected that classifiers using alternative bands and/or combinations of object measurements will be more appropriate for specific science cases.</span>

<h3 class="fixdown">2. Why does <code>THETAWIN_IMAGE</code> have such strange spikes?  &nbsp; &nbsp; <a style="font-size:0.72rem" href="javascript:void(0)" on-tap="_top">(Top)</a></h3>

<div class="answer" style="diplay: inline;">
    A histogram of THETAWIN_IMAGE appears to be quantized, with angles of 90 degrees and 45 appearing much more commonly than angles in between (<a href="javascript:void(0)" on-tap="_dialog" data-item="1"/>Figure 1</a>).
<p>What's going on?   In short, object detection in sextractor requires about 5 contiguous pixels to be above background for an object detction. Some configurations of these 5 contiguous pixels are not allowed, such as pixels that only touch at the corners, full edge continuity is required.  For faint objects, allowed patterns in the pixel checkerboard of 5 touching pixels result in a measured position angle (THETAWIN_IMAGE) of certain angles, like 0, 90, 45, 90-45 degrees, and to a lessor extent 18.4, 90-18.4 degrees to be much more common (see upper panel of first figure).   If one selects a subset of objects with:</p>
<p>b_image &gt; 0.9 .AND. ( (mag_auto_i &lt; 19 and 1-b_image/a_image &lt; 0.2) OR (1-b_image/a_image &lt; 0.2 + (mag_auto_i-19)/5 )), one rejects very small objects and also objects which are bright and very elongated or somewhat fainter and slightly more elongated), one can get rid of most of the spikes in the histogram (lower panel of <a href="javascript:void(0)" on-tap="_dialog" data-item="1"/>Figure 1</a>).  The over-represented 5-edge-contiguous-pixel configurations are shown in <a href="javascript:void(0)" on-tap="_dialog" data-item="2"/>Figure 2</a>.</p>

<h3 class="fixdown">3. Where is <code>THETA_IMAGE</code>? How do I draw ellipses in image coordinates?  &nbsp; &nbsp; <a style="font-size:0.72rem" href="javascript:void(0)" on-tap="_top">(Top)</a></h3>
<div class="answer" style="diplay: inline;">Users of the DR1 sample will note that quantities THETAWIN_IMAGE_{grizY} are present, along with the quantity THETA_J2000 (with no band suffix).
<p>THETA_IMAGE is missing.  Error quantities ERRTHETAWIN_IMAGE_{grizY} are available, and ERRTHETA_IMAGE, but no ERRTHETA_J2000.</p>
<p>What's going on?  Part of this is for historical reasons, but one should be able to use these quantities for your science and for drawing accurate ellipses around your objects of interest.  The quantities with _IMAGE in them are sextractor image coordinate quantities.  The quantity with _J2000 is in the 'world coordinate system'.  Since the coadd tiles x,y axes are aligned with RA,DEC the angles contain basically the same information and may be used interchangable, modulo a 90 degree difference.</p>
<p>The quantities without the band suffix (A_IMAGE,B_IMAGE,THETA_J2000) are measured off of the so called detection image, an image which combines the r,i and z band filters. </p>
<p>The THETA_J2000 angle is related to the missing THETA_IMAGE angle very nearly by the relation: MOD(THETA_IMAGE+180,180) =MOD(THETA_J2000+90,180)  where the MOD operation is modulus, and maps the resulting angles into the range 0 &lt;= angle &lt; 180.</p>
<p>To overlay ellipses on your galaxies and other objects, using, for instance, a .reg file in DS9:  select from the database the quantities RA,DEC,A_IMAGE, B_IMAGE and THETA_J2000+90 for your set of objects.  Then construct a .reg region file which has lines of the form:</p>
<p>J2000 (first line)</p>
<p>ELLIPSE &lt;RA&gt; &lt;DEC&gt; &lt;A_IMAGE&gt;" &lt;B_IMAGE&gt;" &lt;90+THETA_J2000&gt; #color=&lt;color&gt; width=&lt;liinewidth&gt;</p>
<p>for instance if for two objects on tile DES0203-4914 have:</p>
<p>(ra,dec,a_image,b_image,theta_j2000) = (31.32668 deg ,-48.93462 deg , 13.38 pixel,3.95 pixels, 75.7 deg)</p>
<p>(ra,dec,a_image,b_image,theta_j2000) = (31.32832 deg ,-48.93039 deg , 6.08 pixel,3.58 pixels, 44.97 deg)</p>
<p>A .reg file with these three lines, overlaid on the ds9 displayed image:</p>
<p>J2000</p>
<p>ellipse  31.326685      -48.934621      13.38"  3.95"   165.700 #color=red width=3</p>
<p>ellipse  31.328324      -48.930391      6.08"   3.58"   134.97 #color=yellow width=3</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>will draw red and yellow ellipses around the objects.  Note that the A_IMAGE/B_IMAGE unit is in pixels of 0.263'' each but the units in the .reg file are arcsec. A rough factor of 1 pixel per image ''  is used to give a pleasing object-encircling radius for your ellipse (you may wish to adjust).  The double quote mark (") should follow the a/b sizes and one decimal place should be enough.</p>
<p>Figure 3 shows  a DS9 snapshot of the i-band fits image for tile DES0203-4914 (retrieved from the DR1 footprint tool).  The above .reg file is then loaded as a region.</p>

<h3 class="fixdown">4. Where are <code>FLUX_PSF</code> and <code>MAG_PSF</code>?  &nbsp; &nbsp; <a style="font-size:0.72rem" href="javascript:void(0)" on-tap="_top">(Top)</a></h3>
<p class="answer">
  <span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">The PSF model has limited flexibility to accommodate discontinuities in the effective PSF that can occur in coadded images at boundaries in coverage between individual exposures. In these regions, the local PSF model can fail to accurately fit the point-like sources, and accordingly, both the coadd morphological classifications  and coadd PSF photometry are suspect. The photometry of extended sources is impacted to a lesser degree. Generally, more robust treatment (especially for point-like sources) is possible with weighted-average quantities, at the cost of some loss of object detection completeness for the faintest sources</span>
  <span style="color: rgb(0,0,0);">. Due to the known issues in coadd PSF photometry, DES DR1 does not include the coadd MAG_PSF quantities. For studies of point-like sources we recommend the use of WAVG_MAG_PSF (bright sources) or MAG_AUTO (faint sources).

<p class="answer">
  <span>Among all the objects detected and cataloged, ~2.3% have been flagged by IMAFLAGS_ISO in at least one of the</span> <em> grizY </em> <span>bands, and ~0.1% have artifacts in all 5 bands.<br/> </span> <span>It is recommended to use IMAFLAGS_ISO = 0 as a first filter of clean objects. Most of the objects with IMAFLAGS_ISO = 1 are saturated stars</span> <span>. A smaller fraction of flagged objects are missing imaging data in one or more of the bands</span> <span>, and usually have NITER_MODEL = 0, which is set for objects that did not converge during the photometry measurement.</span>

<p class="answer">You can use the interactive tools, <a href="https://des.ncsa.illinois.edu/easyweb/footprint">https://des.ncsa.illinois.edu/easyweb/footprint</a> or here <a href="https://desportal2.cosmology.illinois.edu/dri/apps/home/">https://desportal2.cosmology.illinois.edu/dri/apps/home/</a> .  Using Healpix you can locate a position (or a set of positions) within a Healpix cell, then you can select the cell and the objects within directly from the DR1 DB. HPIX resolutions in NESTED schema are available at nside = 32, 64, 1024,4096,16384</p>

<h3 class="fixdown">7. Is <code>FLUX_RADIUS</code> a flux or a radius? &nbsp; &nbsp; <a style="font-size:0.72rem" href="javascript:void(0)" on-tap="_top">(Top)</a></h3>
<p class="answer">It is a radius measurement, it's the half-light radius for the object, from elliptical growth-curve, modeled in 2 dimensions. If the profile is Gaussian, then  FWHM = 2*FLUX_RADIUS .</p>

<h3 class="fixdown">8. What is the difference between the "DR1 Standard Bandpasses" and the "Y3A1 Standard Bandpasses"? &nbsp; &nbsp; <a style="font-size:0.72rem" href="javascript:void(0)" on-tap="_top">(Top)</a></h3>
<p class="answer">The DR1 standard bandpasses contain the DES survey's present best knowledge of the true filter bandpasses of the DECam CCD+Filter system.  The Y3A1 Standard Bandpasses have slightly different behavior in the far out-of-band regions of some filters.  This can result in a color-dependent magnitude difference for very red objects (g-r &gt; 1.5, i.e. late M-star and redder) of a few mmag.  The magnitudes in the DR1 release have <strong>not</strong> been corrected to account for what the survey understands about the out-of-band behavior of the DES filters, as that analyses is proceeding.  For essentially all science projects the systematic difference is much smaller than other photometric errors.</p>
