      <p>The images and catalogs generated by DESDM for DR1 can also be accessed by an interface developed by the Laboratorio Interinstitucional de e-Astronomia (LIneA) which supports the participation of Brazilian scientists in DES. It has been designed to offer ways to examine both images and catalogs, compare these with the results of other surveys, and examine the results of queries to the database. The interface consists of the following three services:</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sky/Image viewer</strong>: The Sky/Image viewer combination integrates third-party tools to allow the user to visualize the entire sky map produced by DES (<a href="http://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/">Aladin Light developed by CDS</a>) in the form of a HIPs color coded image as well as each individual tile using <a href="https://www.astromatic.net/software/visiomatic">VisiOmatic</a>. The native functions, such as zoom, have been augmented with: 1) an image layer that allows the display of other surveys; 2) a position locator; 3) the possibility of sharing a display with other users; 4) a map viewer which enables the display of HEALpix maps generated during the processing of the data (e.g., map of the number of images available at each point in the sky); 5) different grids including the original coadd tiles and the border of the DES footprint; 6) access to the image of a specific tile which can be examined using VisiOmatic The image viewer can be used to examine the tile as a whole and to inspect a specific position on the sky in more detail using the native functions of the tool which include snapshot, profile overlays, contrast settings, color mix, zoom, full screen mode, and catalog overlay. The interface also allows side-by-side comparison of the same sky region using different settings. Other useful functions are the ability to switch on/off markers, recenter the display to provide a visualization of the entire tile, crop part of the image, and download the fits images and catalog associated with the tile being displayed.</p>
      <p>Finally, one can also overlay object catalogs which are classified into three categories: 1) targets - list of positions or objects either uploaded or created using the Target viewer and User Query services described below; 2) object catalog - the DES DR1 object catalog produced by DESDM; 3) external catalogs - a sample of catalogs available in Vizier. To facilitate the comparison between catalogs, the user can change the symbol, color, and size of each catalog it selects to display.</p>
      <p>
        <strong>Target Viewer</strong>: This service enables the user to examine a list of uploaded positions of objects selected using the User Query service described below. The first page provides a summary of the available target lists, the ability to upload/delete lists, and the ability to mark favorite lists. Adding a list can be done by pasting a list of RA and Dec coordinates. Once a list is selected the image surrounding an object/position can be visualized by selecting an entry in the list and the corresponding position. The user can then select the columns to be shown, sort according to a given attribute, and comment, rank and reject an entry. </p>
      <p>
        <strong>User Query</strong>: This service provides access to the database table storing the DES DR1 data from which SQL queries can be written, validated, and executed. The resulting table is displayed under “My Tables” where it can be deleted, renamed, and a few lines of its content listed. Objects selected can be immediately viewed in the Target Viewer after the columns of the resulting table are properly associated with those recognized by the tool.</p>
      <p>Given the suite of functionalities available in each tool, tutorials in the form of videos have been prepared to help introduce first-time users to the services. Information about the current limitations is available in the help associated with each tool.</p>
      <p>More information on using these services is available on the LIneA Server  page, <a href="https://desportal2.cosmology.illinois.edu/dri/apps/home/">https://desportal2.cosmology.illinois.edu/dri/apps/home/</a>
